# Jupyter Notebooks

`Jupyter` notebooks are a web-based interactive computing environment that allows users to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
`Jupyter` notebooks support a variety of programming languages, including `Python`, `R`, `Julia`, and many others.

The name "`Jupyter`" is a combination of the three main programming languages it supports: `Julia`, `Python`, and `R`.

In a `Jupyter` notebook, code is executed in cells, which are individual units of executable code.
Users can edit and run cells interactively, and the results are displayed within the notebook document.
This allows for an exploratory and iterative coding process, where users can experiment with different code snippets and immediately see the results.

In addition to code cells, `Jupyter` notebooks also support Markdown cells, which allow users to write formatted text and include images and other media.
This makes it possible to create rich, interactive documents that combine code, text, and visualizations.

`Jupyter` notebooks have become a popular tool for data analysis, machine learning, scientific computing, and education, as they provide an intuitive and flexible environment for exploring and sharing code and data.
