# Python Packages

`Python` code can be packaged into modules and libraries.
`Poetry` is a tool for managing and creating our own packages.

In this section we'll create a package for generating Mandelbrot plots, and finish off by publishing it to `PyPI`.

Each chapter will build on the previous one.
The `README.md` file in each chapter will contain a summary of the changes made in that chapter.

To explicitly see the changes made in each chapter, you can use `git diff`:

```bash
git diff chapters/0_Poetry_Init chapters/1_Adding_Python
```

## Chapters

-   [Poetry Init](./chapters/0_Poetry_Init/README.md)
