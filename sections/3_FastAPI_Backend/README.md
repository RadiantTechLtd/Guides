# FastAPI Backend

`FastAPI` is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with `Python`.
It uses standard `Python` type hints to describe the inputs and outputs of your API.

In this section we'll create an HTTP API to share our Mandelbrot plots with the world!

Each chapter will build on the previous one.
The `README.md` file in each chapter will contain a summary of the changes made in that chapter.

To explicitly see the changes made in each chapter, you can use `git diff`:

```bash
git diff --no-index chapters/0_Init/api/main.py chapters/1_Mandelbrot/api/main.py
```
