# Node.js - JavaScript runtime

`Node.js` is a free and open-source `JavaScript` runtime environment that allows developers to run `JavaScript` code outside of a web browser.

## Installation

You can install `Node.js` using `Homebrew`:

```bash
brew install node
```

## Usage

You can create a new project using the `npm` command:

```bash
npm init
```

This will create a new `package.json` file in the current directory, which contains information about the project, including the project name, version, and dependencies.

You can install dependencies using:

```bash
npm install some_dependency
```

This will install the specified dependency and add it to the `package.json` file.

You can run a script with:

```bash
npm run my_script
```

## Details

`Node.js` is an open-source, cross-platform, server-side `JavaScript` runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side applications using `JavaScript`.
It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, making it ideal for building scalable network applications.

Some key features of `Node.js` include:

-   Asynchronous programming: `Node.js` allows developers to write asynchronous code, which means that I/O operations can be performed without blocking the execution of other tasks.
-   Built-in modules: `Node.js` provides a set of built-in modules that make it easy to perform tasks such as file input/output, networking, and cryptography.
-   Package manager: `Node.js` has a built-in package manager called `npm` (Node Package Manager) that makes it easy to install, share, and manage third-party libraries and tools.
-   Cross-platform: `Node.js` can run on a wide range of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
-   Large and active community: `Node.js` has a large and active community of developers and users, which means that there is a wealth of resources and support available for developers who are using the platform.

Overall, `Node.js` provides developers with a powerful and flexible tool for building server-side applications using `JavaScript`.
Its support for asynchronous programming and built-in modules make it easy to build high-performance applications that can handle large volumes of traffic, while its package manager and large community make it easy to find and use third-party libraries and tools.
