# Python - Language Interpreter

`Python` is a programming language that is used to write high-level code.

## Installation

Although a version of the `Python` interpreter is already installed on your computer, you can install a newer version using `Homebrew`:

```bash
brew install python
```

By default, the interpreter will be installed under the command `python3`, but you can create an alias for the `Python` command to make it easier to use:

```bash
echo 'alias python="python3"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
