# Poetry - Virtual Environments Manager

`Poetry` provides an easy-to-use command-line interface for creating, publishing, and managing `Python` packages and their dependencies.

## Installation

You can install `Poetry` using `Homebrew`:

```bash
brew install poetry
```

## Usage

To create a new `Python` project, run the following command:

```bash
poetry new my_project
```

You can then install the project's dependencies, and the `my_project` package itself using the following command:

```bash
poetry install
```

You can then run a script (which may `import my_project`) using the following command:

```bash
poetry run python path/to/my_script.py
```

If you want to add a new dependency to the project, you can do so using the following command:

```bash
poetry add some_dependency
```

If you want to add a new development dependency to the project, you can do so using the following command:

```bash
poetry add --dev some_dev_dependency
```

To publish the project to `PyPI`, run the following command:

```bash
poetry publish
```

## Details

`Poetry` is a tool for managing `Python` dependencies and packaging `Python` applications. It provides an easy-to-use command-line interface for creating, publishing, and managing `Python` packages and their dependencies.

With `Poetry`, developers can:

-   Manage dependencies: `Poetry` simplifies the management of project dependencies by automatically resolving and installing the required dependencies for a project.
-   Create virtual environments: `Poetry` can create and manage virtual environments for Python projects, which helps to isolate the project's dependencies from the system's `Python` environment.
-   Build and publish packages: `Poetry` provides tools for building and publishing `Python` packages to the `Python` Package Index (`PyPI`) or a private repository.
-   Versioning: `Poetry` can help to manage versioning of packages and their dependencies, making it easy to maintain compatibility across different versions of `Python`.

Overall, `Poetry` simplifies the process of managing `Python` dependencies and packaging Python applications, making it a useful tool for `Python` developers who want to streamline their development process and focus on writing code.
