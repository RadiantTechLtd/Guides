# Rust - Language Compiler

`Rust` is a programming language that is used to write low-level, high-performance code.

## Installation

You can install `Rust`'s toolchain using `Homebrew`:

```bash
brew install rust
```

## Details

`Rust` is a systems programming language developed by Mozilla.
It was first released in 2010 and has since gained popularity among developers for its performance, reliability, and safety.

`Rust` is designed to provide a balance between low-level control and high-level abstractions, making it a good choice for systems programming tasks such as building numerical simulations, game engines and operating systems.

Some key features of `Rust` include:

-   Memory safety: `Rust` uses a system of ownership and borrowing to ensure that memory is managed safely, without the risk of common bugs such as null pointer dereferences or buffer overflows.
-   Concurrency: `Rust` has built-in support for concurrency, with features such as lightweight threads, message passing, and shared memory.
-   Performance: `Rust` is designed to be fast and efficient, with a low-level syntax and a focus on minimizing overhead.
-   Cross-platform: `Rust` can be compiled to run on a wide range of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
-   Open-source: `Rust` is developed under an open-source license, which means that the source code is freely available for anyone to use and modify.

Overall, `Rust` is a powerful and versatile programming language that provides developers with the tools they need to build fast, reliable, and safe systems-level software.
Its focus on memory safety and performance makes it a good choice for developers who need low-level control over their code, while its built-in concurrency features make it well-suited for modern, multi-core processors.
