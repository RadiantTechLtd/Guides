# iTerm2 - Terminal

`iTerm2` is a replacement for the default `MacOS` terminal.
It has a lot of features that make the development experience better.

## Installation

```bash
brew install --cask iterm2
```

Close the `terminal` application and open `iTerm` instead.
Any time I refer to the terminal in this guide, I mean the `iTerm2` one.

## Setup

With the `iTerm` application open, go to `Preferences` and select the `Appearance` tab.
Within the `General` tab, set `Theme` to `Minimal`, and `Status Bar` to `Bottom`.

In the `Profiles` tab, select the `Session` tab, and then check `Status bar enabled` at the bottom of the window and then click the `Configure Status Bar` button.

I like to have the `Battery Level`, `CPU Utilization`, `Memory Utilization`, `Network Throughput` in my status bar.
