# `CSS` - Styling

`CSS` stands for **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets.
Like `HTML` it is a declarative language.
`CSS` is a language for describing the presentation of web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers.

## Details

`CSS` separates the presentation of a document from its content, allowing developers to control the visual aspects of a web page independently of its structure and content.
By using `CSS`, developers can specify font styles, colours, margins, padding, and other layout properties for elements on a web page.

Some key features of `CSS` include:

-   Cascading rules: `CSS` uses cascading rules to determine which styles should be applied to an element when there are conflicting style rules.
-   Selectors: `CSS` uses selectors to select the elements that should be styled.
-   Inheritance: `CSS` properties can be inherited from parent elements to child elements, reducing the amount of code needed to style a web page.
-   Box model: `CSS` uses a box model to describe the layout of elements on a web page, including their padding, borders, and margins.
-   Responsive design: `CSS` provides tools for creating responsive designs, allowing web pages to adjust their layout and style based on the size and orientation of the screen they are viewed on.

Overall, `CSS` is a powerful tool for controlling the layout and style of web pages.
Its support for cascading rules, selectors, inheritance, box model, and responsive design make it an essential part of modern web development.
