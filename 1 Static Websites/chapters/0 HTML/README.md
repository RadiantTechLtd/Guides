# HTML - Structure

`HTML` stands for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage.
It is a declarative language, meaning that it simply describes something, rather than instructing the computer how to do something.
It is the foundation of all websites and is used to structure the page.

## Details

`HTML` is used to structure content on a web page by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links. Each element is defined using `HTML` tags, which are surrounded by angle brackets (< >).

Some key features of `HTML` include:

-   Structure: `HTML` provides a structured way to define the content on a web page, allowing developers to separate content from presentation.
-   Semantics: `HTML` provides a way to define the meaning of the content on a web page, making it more accessible to users with disabilities and more discoverable by search engines.
-   Compatibility: `HTML` is supported by all major web browsers and can be used on a wide range of platforms, including desktop and mobile devices.
-   Extensibility: `HTML` can be extended using other technologies, such as `CSS` for styling and `JavaScript` for interactivity.

Overall, `HTML` is a fundamental building block of the World Wide Web.
Its support for structure, semantics, compatibility, and extensibility makes it an essential tool for web development.
